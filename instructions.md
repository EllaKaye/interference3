## How to Play

- The aim is to arrange each row in ascending order, from 2 to King (followed by a space), one row per suit.

- At the start, the deck is shuffled and dealt into four rows of thirteen cards, then the Aces are removed to create spaces.

- Drag and drop cards into spaces to move them, according to the following rules:

    - If there's a space at the beginning of the row, any 2 can go there.

    - Otherwise, you can only move a card into a space if it's the same suit and one rank higher than the card to the left of the space, e.g. only the 3♠️ can be placed after the 2♠️, only the J♥️ can be placed after 10♥️.

    - Nothing can go after a King, or after a space.

- When dragging a card and hovering over a space, the space will turn paler green if the move is valid.

- The layout is blocked if there are no valid moves left, i.e. if all spaces are after Kings or other spaces.

- When the layout is blocked, to start a new round, click the 'New Round' button. This will collect and shuffle all the cards that are not yet arranged by suit in ascending order at the start of a row, then deal them out again to fill the rows, leaving one space in each row, after the ordered cards (or a space at the start of the row, if it doesn't yet start with a 2).

- A game consists of up to three rounds.

- Because there are up to four valid moves at any time, this version of patience/solitaire requires skill. You have a better chance of success if you think strategically. What's the sequence of consequences of each valid move? What card would you like to be able to move, and what other cards need to move to make that possible?

- The game ends when all rows are arranged in ascending order by suit, or when the third round is stuck.

- Start a new game by clicking the 'New Game' button.
